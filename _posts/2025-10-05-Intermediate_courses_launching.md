Building on UFIT Research Computing’s popular Practicum AI Beginner Series of courses, we are excited to announce that the first two of the Intermediate Series are now available online through UF’s Professional and Workforce Development site. All Practicum AI courses remain free for UF students, faculty, and staff. See [this page](https://gravity.rc.ufl.edu/sso/practicum-ai/) for the discount code (requires GatorLink authentication).

* **Computer Vision**

  This course covers training AI models for image classification, object detection and image segmentation. We explore how computers learn to understand and interpret visual information from the world. From the basics of the convolutional neural network (CNN) to data augmentation, transfer learning and vision transformers, this course provides a solid foundation for coding computer vision applications.
* **Transfer Learning**

  Transfer learning allows you to leverage the network architecture and trained weights from other researchers and apply these in new contexts. This course covers feature extraction, model fine-tuning, and adaptation. From image models to language models, we discuss the mechanics of transfer learning and provide hands-on coding examples, taking models from Hugging Face and putting those to work in your AI task.
