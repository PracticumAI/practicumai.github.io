This series of modules introduces learners to natural language processing (NLP). NLP is used in everything from recommender systems that suggest related products when you shop online to automated translation and speech to text.

In this series, we cover "traditional" NLP, introducing the key concepts of tokenization, stop words, embedding and training, as well as newer methods using transformers. For more information on transformers, see our [transformers course](/_courses/transformers/).
