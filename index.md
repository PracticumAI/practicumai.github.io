# Practicum AI: Building AI Knowledge

Presented by [UF Research Computing](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/), Practicum AI is a hands-on applied AI curriculum intended for students with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, our hope is to support learners who seek to begin applied AI research.
