*Topics: The following topics are covered in this module:*

* The Right Task for the Job
* Implementing Computer Vision Models with Python APIs
* Data Manipulation for Computer Vision Models

## Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Select appropriate models for specific computer vision tasks.
* Implement Python APIs for computer vision model development.
* Evaluate a dataset’s suitability for training a computer vision model.
* Manipulate datasets using Python for vision model training. 
* Discuss different architectures’ suitability for different computer vision tasks.

## Practice and Apply

### Object Detection Exercise

You now have a better understanding of how to select the right models for different tasks, implement them using powerful APIs, and evaluate their performance on datasets.  Most importantly, you have learned how to manipulate and prepare your image data to give your models the best chance of success.  The next step?  An object detection exercise!

Let’s head back to our Jupyter Notebooks to continue: [https://github.com/PracticumAI/computer_vision](https://github.com/PracticumAI/computer_vision)

Using the same resource requests as in module 1, complete notebook **02_boxes_of_fruit.ipynb**, which will introduce you to object detection.
