# Getting started in AI ![Practicum AI Beginner Series Icon](/images/icons/practicumai-beginner.png) 

The Practicum AI Beginner series has three modules that lead beginning learners through an introduction to AI, ethical considerations, an introduction to the Python programming language and hands-on deep learning activities.

## Module 1: Ethics and AI ![AI Ethics icon](/images/icons/noun_ethics_green.svg)

This module covers ethical considerations and challenges in AI.

### Learning Objectives

1. Name the generally accepted principles which ought to inform one's research (Beneficence, Justice, Respect for Persons, Respect for Law & Public Interest)
1. Compare and contrast the ethical frameworks of Consequentialism and Deontology
1. Apply ethical principles while collecting and curating data
1. Recognize the inherent complexity of ethical thinking and the need to balance competing interests

## Module 2: Introduction to Python Workshop ![Python icon](/images/icons/noun_Python_green.svg)

The vast majority of hands-on artificial intelligence work is currently done using the Python programming language. As such, *some* understanding of Python, in particular, and computer programming, in general, is needed to be successful in applying AI. That said, it is truly astounding how much complex AI research can be accomplished with a few lines of code!

## Module 3: Deep Learning Foundations ![Deep Learning Foundations icon](/images/icons/noun_DeepLearning_green.svg)

This  series introduces learners to the foundations of deep learning.

### Learning Objectives

1. Provide an accurate definition of AI and its two primary sub-domains
1. Create a Jupyter notebook using the JupyterLab IDE with Python and Markdown blocks
1. Write Python code to create and then execute the resnet50 pre-trained model
1. Name the basic types of neural network and common applications for each
1. Recognize that AI algorithms are narrowly focused and often break in unexpected ways
1. Describe the basic operation of a neural network
1. Identify the components of a neural network and their relation to each other
1. Construct a single node perceptron in Python
1. Describe how gradient descent works and its mathematical underpinnings
1. Identify the various components of gradient descent and their relation to each other
1. Explain the function of key hyperparameters and their role in training
1. Be able to tweak a model's hyperparameters to enhance its performance
1. Construct a multi-layered neural network using Keras
