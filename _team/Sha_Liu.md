After graduating from Information Systems and Operations Management master program, I joined the UFIT Project Management office as IT Analyst 3 years ago. With my passion and love as a gator, I use technical tools to generate dynamic and interactive dashboards to improve work efficiency for project management. Always being open and keep learning is my faith.

I love Disney, free diving, scuba diving, yoga, and exploring the world with my two dogs.
