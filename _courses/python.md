Artificial Intelligence has advanced a lot, but still requires human input. Humans must still prepare the data, setup and train the models, and interpret the results. These steps, while increasingly assisted by AI itself, require some understanding of computer programming, or code. In particular, most modern AI development is done in the programming language Python.

This course is not an attempt to teach you everything there is to know about Python--that would take much longer and, arguably, is not even achievable. Instead, we aim to introduce basic programming concepts, cover the basics of syntax, or how to write Python code, and provide enough background to get started in AI.

The *Practicum AI* Python for AI course has three modules.
