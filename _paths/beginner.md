# Getting started in AI

The Practicum AI Beginner series has four courses that lead beginning learners through an introduction to AI, ethical considerations, an overview of the computational tools used in applied AI, an introduction to the Python programming language, and hands-on deep learning activities.

All courses are available free from the links below, or register via the [UF Professional Workforce and Development site](https://reg.pwd.aa.ufl.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=5723886&selectedProgramAreaId=1015758&selectedProgramStreamId=1016506&_ga=2.103746304.1240746877.1712159539-1362051868.1703172067&_gl=1*1xh4o0s*_ga*MTM2MjA1MTg2OC4xNzAzMTcyMDY3*_ga_P8DV6LYX8P*MTcxMjIzODM3Ny4yLjEuMTcxMjI0MTQ0MC42MC4wLjA.*_gcl_au*MTQ3OTU3NzMwMy4xNzEyMTU5NTM5) for online courses with quizzes, completion badges and a certificate.

                Here we introduce you to artificial intelligence–it’s a term we hear a lot, but can you define it? Did you know that AI research dates back to the 1950s? As you start to learn about AI, we will provide a brief overview of what AI is and is not, its origins and get you prepared to conduct hands-on applied AI in the other courses that make up Practicum AI.

                This course will teach you about some of the tools recommended for building, testing, tweaking, and deploying AI models. You will learn about Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub, and high-performance computing (HPC) environments. These key technologies have become the industry standards for hands-on, applied AI research and development.

            Artificial Intelligence has advanced a lot, but still requires human input. Humans must still prepare the data, setup and train the models, and interpret the results. These steps, while increasingly assisted by AI itself, require some understanding of computer programming, or code. In particular, most modern AI development is done in the programming language Python.

            Deep learning is the focus of modern AI. Models have many layers and millions, or now approaching a trillion, parameters! This course breaks things down and introduces you to a small AI model to provide a conceptual understanding of how AI models are built, trained and deployed.
