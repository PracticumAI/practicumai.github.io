This series of modules introduces learners to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are used in analyzing time series data, where knowledge of the state at previous time points is helpful in predicting a future time point.Applications include forecasting stock prices to predicting patient outcomes based on treatment and vitals over time.
