# Practicum AI: Building AI Knowledge

Presented by UF Research Computing, Practicum AI is a hands-on applied AI curriculum intended for students with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, our hope is to support learners who seek to begin applied AI research.
