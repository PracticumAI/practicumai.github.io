I am a recent UF grad of the Materials Science and Engineering Department. With over 16 years of service in the U.S. Air Force, I have spent a considerable amount of time training people on the implementation and use of new technologies. I have also co-authored two high-school level AI courses that are currently being piloted across the state of Florida right now!

I enjoy reading horror-comedy novels and play as much Dungeons and Dragons as I can get away with.
