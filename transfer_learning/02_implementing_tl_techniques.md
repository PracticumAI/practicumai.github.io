## Topics: The following topics are covered in this module:

* How to Transfer Learning
* Extracting Features
* Time for a tune-up
* My friend, LoRA
* Comparing Transfer Learning Strategies

## Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Demonstrate basic coding proficiencies required to implement feature extraction with a computer vision model.  
* Demonstrate basic coding proficiencies required to implement fine-tuning with a computer vision model.
* Demonstrate basic coding proficiencies required to implement LoRA with a language model. 
* Compare and contrast the benefits of different transfer learning strategies.

### Transfer Learning Techniques Exercise

It’s time for the gauntlet. We’re going to be implementing three different techniques to give you a wide breadth of experience using these tools.
