## Summary

The history of artificial intelligence is important.  It helps to know how others have thought about and defined intelligence.  It also allows us to appreciate the different ways in which scientists have sought to make machines intelligent.  These can be divided into two broad categories: top-down and bottom-up.  In this module, both top-down and bottom-up approaches to AI are covered, including the famous Turing Test.  This historical knowledge, in turn, allows us to see how AI has developed over time - the rise of machine learning followed by a renewed interest in neural networks.

### Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Compose a short definition of artificial intelligence.
1. Describe the relationship between machine learning and deep learning and identify appropriate techniques for common types of data.
1. Outline the lifecycle steps of an AI project and the importance of each.
1. Contrast *top-down* (knowledge representation) approaches to AI with *bottom-up* (data driven) approaches.
1. Provide concrete examples of how AI is used in at least one area of interest.

### Read
