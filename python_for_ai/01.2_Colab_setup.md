## Launch notebooks in Google Colab

While not technically Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colaboratory is a nearly identical environment that provides free access to some compute resources, including GPUs for AI analyses. The free tier is limited in how long analyses can run and how many simultaneous notebooks you can have running at a time. Still, it should be sufficient for the exercises in the Practicum AI courses and some basic AI research. You may want to upgrade to a paid plan for larger projects, but that is not needed for the Practicum AI courses.

> University of Florida associated Google accounts may not work with Google Colab, you may need to use a personal Google account.

* Once you have a Google account, log in to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

If you are new to Notebooks, the Welcome to Colaboratory notebook is a great tutorial that will get you started.

* Now, we are ready to open the notebook from the GitHub repository you created above.
* From the **File Menu**, select **Open Notebook**.
* Click on the GitHub tab and then type your GitHub username followed by the name of the repository: e.g. `username/python-for-ai`

* Then, double-click on the **01_intro_to_jupyter.ipynb** notebook to open it.
* Read through the notebook and follow complete the exercises.
