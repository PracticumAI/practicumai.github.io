I'm an IT analyst at UF Health IT Educational Technologies (EdTech).  My primary area of focus is in video conferencing and collaboration technologies.  I also consult on a variety of technical and AV projects and serve as an IT trainer (Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and OneNote).  I'm currently pursuing an Educational Technologies certificate in Instructional Design at the College of Education.

While I'm always learning innovative and emerging technologies, I have a deep interest in learning AI, machine learning and deep learning.

I love traveling, trying new food, reading, rucking, and spending time with the family.
