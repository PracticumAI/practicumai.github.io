## Exercise

Now that we've thoroughly explored the basics of neural networks, let's get our hands dirty with creating one ourselves. The following exercise will use the Python coding language inside a Jupyter Notebook environment to give you a quick introduction to doing AI with code!

The notebooks for the Deep Learning Foundations course are located at the deep learning directory on our Practicum AI GitHub. For this course, there are two versions: the original version that used TensorFlow and a version launched in August of 2025 that uses PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning. Access either:

* [TensorFlow version](https://github.com/PracticumAI/deep_learning)
* [PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning version](https://github.com/PracticumAI/deep_learning_pt-lightning) (use this if you are unsure which to use)

For either version, once you are on the repository page:

* Click the "Use this template" button to make your copy of the repository.
   * If you need details on how to do this, please [see this page on creating your GitHub repository from the template](/deep_learning/create_repo/).
* Open a session on HiPerGator, Google Colab, or your HPC (we will want a GPU for these exercises).
   * If you need details for this step, please view the appropriate page:
      * [Launching Jupyter on HiPerGator](/deep_learning/launch_jupyter_HPG/).
      * [Launching a Google Colab session](/deep_learning/launch_colab/).
* Work through notebook **01_deep_learning_tour.ipynb**.
* Stuck or need to see this in action? 
  * Watch the Deep Learning Tour Walkthrough video:
