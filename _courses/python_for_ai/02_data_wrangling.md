Artificial intelligence is powered by data! Learning to work with various data formats and explore your data is the first step to learning how to apply AI tools to learn from your data. The Pandas library provides an extensive set of tools for working with data, particularly data in tables. This module will teach you the basics of Pandas and working with tabular data. 

Visualizing your data is one way of learning about it. While there are many more powerful visualization tools, Pandas has several easy-to-use tools to make quick work of data exploration. 

## Topics

* Data Analysis with Pandas
* Data Visualization


## Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Manipulate and visualize data using Pandas
