As you did in Module 1, in Colab, select File > Open notebook and then select the GitHub Tab. Your username and the ‘computing-for-ai’ repo should still be selected, but if not, go ahead and add those.

Select to open the notebook called **02_git_configuration_Google_Colab.ipynb**.

Follow the directions in the notebook to File > Save to GitHub and authorize your Google account in GitHub.

Return to the [Module 3 page](/computing_for_ai/03_git_and_github/) to continue with the next step.
