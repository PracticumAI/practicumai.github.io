Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that introduces low-rank updates to specific layers of a pre-trained model. Instead of updating all model parameters, LoRA modifies only a subset of them, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining performance.

## What Makes a Model Suitable for LoRA?

LoRA is most effective for models that have many parameters and benefit from attention-based mechanisms, such as:

* Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5) where self-attention layers can be efficiently modified.
* Vision transformers (ViTs) process image data through self-attention mechanisms.
* Multimodal models like BLIP, which integrate both vision and language features and require efficient adaptation without retraining the entire model.

## LoRA Workflow

1. **Select a Pre-Trained Model:** Choose a model that supports LoRA, such as transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT), vision transformers (e.g., ViT), or multimodal models like BLIP.
1. **Identify Target Layers for LoRA:* Determine which layers will receive low-rank updates, typically attention layers in transformers or specialized layers in multimodal networks.
1. **Apply LoRA Adaptation:** Insert LoRA layers that introduce low-rank modifications without altering the entire model architecture.
1. **Preprocess the Input Data:** Ensure compatibility with the pre-trained model by resizing, normalizing, and tokenizing input.
1. **Train the Model with LoRA:** Fine-tune the model using LoRA-adapted layers, optimizing only the additional parameters.
1. **Evaluate and Optimize:** Assess model performance and refine LoRA parameters to achieve optimal results.
