    <strong>AI is for everyone!</strong> Yes, coding is required for authentic applied AI, but it doesn't take long to learn the basics that are needed--and, of course, we'll teach you!</td>

    <td><strong>Basic math is all that is needed!</strong> While AI is based in complex linear algebra and differential equations, a conceptual understanding is all that is required. AI research and development can certainly benefit from higher level math, but to <i>apply</i> AI methods, we firmly believe that modern AI frameworks (code that facilitates writing AI code) make this unnecessary, and prevent too many people from learning AI.</td>
