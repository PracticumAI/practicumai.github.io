## Summary

**Applied AI is powered by code--Python code.**

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticumAI/getting_started/main/images/Git-Logo-2Color.svg' align='right' width=100 alt='git logo' style='padding: 0px 0px 0px 10px'>As a best practice, code should reside in a version control system. These systems allow collaboration, enforce good coding practices and foster collaboration and sharing. The most widely used version control system today is [`git`](http://git-scm.com/). Git is free and open source. 

<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PracticumAI/getting_started/main/images/GitHub-Mark.png'  align='right' width=100 alt='GitHub logo'>In addition to using `git`, it is possible to use one of many online git hosting sites. For *Practicum AI* we use [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). There are other options, but GitHub is one of the leading online hosting companies and offers [educational discounts for students and faculty](https://education.github.com/).
