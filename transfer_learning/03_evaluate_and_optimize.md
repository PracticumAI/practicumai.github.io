## Topics: The following topics are covered in this module:

* Choosing the Right Pre-Trained Model
* Transfer Learning vs. Full Training
* Evaluating Transfer Learning Techniques
* Performance Evaluation: Measuring the Effectiveness of Transfer Learning
* Common Transfer Learning Issues & Troubleshooting Strategies

## Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Critique a pre-trained model’s suitability for use in transfer learning to a new task and select effective candidate models.
* Assess the trade-offs of transfer learning versus full training and make justifiable choices for their approach.
* Develop intuition on which, if any, transfer learning techniques to use in model development.
* Evaluate the outcome of transfer learning techniques (feature extraction, fine-tuning and LoRA) on model performance.
* Evaluate the outcome of transfer learning techniques compared to a similar model trained without transfer.
* Troubleshoot and remediate common transfer learning model issues like catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer.

## Practice and Apply

### Pre-Trained Model Evaluation Exercise

In this last exercise, we’ll compare different pre-trained models for their suitability as the Source model for feature extraction. Then we’ll practice using evaluation metrics to guide us in improving the new model. Happy coding!
