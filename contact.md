## Getting Help

To support learners and instructors, we have setup a [discussion board on GitHub.com](https://github.com/orgs/PracticumAI/discussions) for posting questions, providing feedback and discussing the content.

## Found an error? Suggest and improvement?

Each of the course repositories on GitHub.com has an **Issues* tab. Please use issues to report errors, suggest content improvements, or note points of confusion.
