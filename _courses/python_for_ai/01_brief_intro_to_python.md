![A brief intro to Python banner](/images/python_m1_banner.png)

The art of Python programming begins with a basic understanding of how the language works, the JupyterLab notebook environment, and the importance of developing a consistent coding style supported by clear documentation. These topics are covered in this first module, along with an initial look at the versatile Python string variable.

## Topics

* Variables and Memory
* Order of Operations
* Data Types
* Libraries
* Functions

## Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

* Understand Python's dominance in data science and its role in high-performance computing.
* Develop Python troubleshooting skills, including documentation referencing and error handling.
* Write Python code adhering to best practices for operators, variables, and functions.
* Utilize Python libraries through the import function and understand major AI libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

## Practice and Apply

In this section, you will work through a Jupyter Notebook and then take a knowledge quiz.

We will need to start a session in the computing environment you plan to use (e.g., HiPerGator or Google Colab) and then clone the *Practicum AI* Python for AI repository.

If you took our Computing for AI course, you have been through the steps of making your repository from our template and launching a session on HiPerGator of Google Colab. The sections below include a general summary of these steps and links to the detailed, step-by-step directions from the earlier course.

### Step 1. Create your repository from the template

* Go to the [GitHub repository for Python for AI](https://github.com/PracticumAI/python-for-ai).
* Click the "Use this template" button and make a copy in your own account

> [Detailed step-by-step instructions](/python_for_ai/01.1_create_repo_details/).

### Step 2. Launch a HiPerGator or Google Colab session

Follow the instructions for the system you are using:

#### Launch a HiPerGator session

* Log in to HiPerGatorLinks to an external site.
* Click Jupyter Notebook
* Resource request should be remembered from the last time, but here's what you need:
    * **Number of CPUs**: 1 or 2
    * **Maximum Memory**: 15GB
    * **SLURM Account and QOS**: Group name as needed.
    * **Time Requested**: 2
    * **Cluster Partition**: default
* Return to your copy of the template, click the **<>Code button**, the **SSH link** (assuming you have SSH keys set up from the Computing for AI course), and copy the URL.
In Jupyter, click the Git tab on the left, and click "Clone a Repository"

#### Launch a Google Colab session

* Log into [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
* This time, the repository we will use as the template is the Practicum AI: Python for AI.
* From the **File Menu** select **Open Notebook**.
* Click on the **GitHub tab** and then type **your GitHub username** followed by the name of the repository: e.g. **username/python-for-ai**.

[Detailed step-by-step instructions for Google Colab.](/python_for_ai/01.2_Colab_setup.md)

### Step 3: Work through the Notebook

Once you have cloned the repository, go ahead and work through Notebook 01_brief_intro_python.ipynb.

* Stuck or need to see this in action? Watch the [01_bried_intro_python.ipynb Notebook Screencast](https://mediasite.video.ufl.edu/Mediasite/Play/a567d5de69cb4231a1167eba362402331d).


## Optional Content / Additional Resources
