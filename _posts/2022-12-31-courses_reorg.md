At Practicum AI, we are always working to make our content more accessible and improve user experience. As we continue developing content, we have transitioned the "Beginner" and "Intermediate" courses to "Learning Paths" and now feature each component course individually. This will align better with our delivery and hopefully make it easier for you to find the content you want.
