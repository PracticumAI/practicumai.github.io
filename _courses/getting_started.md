# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Practicum AI

Welcome! This is the place to start your AI journey.

Here we introduce you to artificial intelligence--it's a term we hear a lot, but can you define it? Did you know that AI research dates back to the 1950s? As you start to learn about AI, we will provide a brief overview of what AI is and is not, its origins and get you prepared to conduct hands-on applied AI in the other courses that make up Practicum AI.
