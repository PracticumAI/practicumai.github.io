This module covers making data for AI/ML FAIR (**F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable).

## Session 1

### Before the session

Before starting this session, [please take this quick pre-assessment](https://ufl.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_7aBxTBOI5K6ubNI).

### Hands-on exercise

[Exercise 1](../../fair/FAIR_Exercise_1/): A Hands-on exploration of data in spreadsheets.

### Objectives

Students recognize the importance of organizing data so that others can understand them by experiencing the challenges of reviewing data sheets that are organized in a common but inappropriate way.

### Learning Outcomes

1. Students can explain why standardizing descriptions and organization of data is important.
1. Students can strategize about the best ways to organize data.

## Session 2

### Before the session

Prior to session 2, students should complete the activity for [Exercise 2](../../fair/FAIR_Exercise_2/): Searching the literature for published datasets.<a href='../../fair/FAIR_Exercise_2/'><img src='/fair/images/fitness-tracker.png' align='right' width='400' style='padding: 0px 0px 0px 20px'></a>

### Objectives

Students recognize the value of accessibly archived data, by experiencing the challenges of accessing data from published papers.

### Learning Outcomes

1. Students can explain why accessible data archiving is valuable.
1. Students can provide strategies for getting data from published papers, and anticipate challenges to accessing the data.
1. Students can define FAIR and the identify the components FAIR data
1. Students can summarize steps involved in FAIR data collection, management, and deposition.
1. Students can define metadata summarize key components of metadata

## Session 3

### Exercise 3

[Exercise 3](../../fair/FAIR_Exercise_3/) will introduce you to data repositories.

### Objectives

1. Students recognize the value of shared data, and develop some skills at searching for data, by searching data repositories for datasets.
1. Students learn about domain-specific and generalist repositories.
1. Students evaluate metadata associated with data found in repositories.
