# Practicum AI: Building AI Knowledge

Presented by [UFIT Research Computing](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/), Practicum AI is a hands-on applied AI curriculum intended for learners with limited coding and math background. Using hands-on exercises and graphically based, conceptual content, our hope is to support learners who seek to begin exploring applied AI.

Practicum AI content can be accessed for FREE via this site, or as self-paced courses with quizzes, completion badges, and certificates via [UF's Professional and Workforce Development site](https://pwd.aa.ufl.edu/ai/).
