## Learning Paths and Certificates

### Beginner Series

This is the best place to start and for best success, we recommend taking the four courses in order. When taken through the [UF Professional and Workforce Development site](https://reg.pwd.aa.ufl.edu/search/publicCourseSearchDetails.do?method=load&courseId=5723886&selectedProgramAreaId=1015758&selectedProgramStreamId=1016506&_gl=1*1k4tr50*_ga*MTM2MjA1MTg2OC4xNzAzMTcyMDY3*_ga_P8DV6LYX8P*MTcxMjIzODM3Ny4yLjEuMTcxMjIzODM5My40NC4wLjA.*_gcl_au*MTQ3OTU3NzMwMy4xNzEyMTU5NTM5&_ga=2.148834871.1240746877.1712159539-1362051868.1703172067), learners can earn the Practicum AI Beginner certification after completing all four beginner courses.

1. **Getting Started with AI**
    * This course is intended to be the first in a series to teach you some tools and techniques to begin training and deploying models independently. The course can also be taken on its own to familiarize yourself with the essential concepts in Artificial Intelligence.
1. I**Computing for AI**
    * This course is the second in the Practicum AI beginner series. This course can also be taken on its own to familiarize yourself with some important tools used in computational science applications.  
1. **Python for AI**
    * The content in this workshop is aimed at beginning coders who may have never programmed before. As with the rest of the Practicum AI workshops, we use Jupyter Notebooks for the learning experience. Jupyter Notebooks are an easy-to-use yet powerful tool that allows interactive coding and nicely formatted explanatory text. Much of exploratory AI research is conducted in Jupyter Notebooks, and it is easy to transfer code from Notebooks to scripts when it is time to scale up analyses.
1. **Deep Learning Foundations**
   * This course is intended to demystify the concepts of neural networks and deep learning. We will touch on how neural networks work, how to use them, and why neural networks have dominated AI research in the past decade. The first module of this course provides a high-level overview of deep learning and some hands-on experience with using these models. This course builds on the previous Practicum AI courses and will require some knowledge of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and high-performance computing environments.

### Intermediate Courses

After getting a foundation in AI through the Beginner series, explore the intermediate courses. We recommend starting with the Convolutional Neural Network course, but after that, let your curiosity guide your selections. Each course is designed to provide a foundation into a particular application of AI. When taken through the UF Professional and Workforce Development site, learners can earn a certification after completing four or more intermediate courses.
