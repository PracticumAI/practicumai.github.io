# Keep learning AI: ![Practicum AI Intermediate Series Icon](/images/icons/practicumai-intermediate.png) 

Intended for learners who have a basic foundation in Python and AI (those that have completed the [*Practicum AI Beginner* Series](/courses/beginner/)), the *Practicum AI Intermediate* series has six modules. These modules each focus on a particular method of AI, introducing learners to hands-on applications of each method and preparing them to apply these methods in their own projects.

## Module 1: Convolutional Neural Networks ![CNN module icon](/images/icons/noun_NeuralNet_green.svg)

This series of modules introduces learners to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
