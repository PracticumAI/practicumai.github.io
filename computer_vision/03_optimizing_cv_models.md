## Practice and Apply

### Segmentation Exercise

It’s time for our final notebook, where we’ll explore one of the more computationally intensive computer vision tasks: segmentation. As before, you’ll get to train and tinker with a new model. Happy Coding!

The notebooks for the Computer Vision course are located at [https://github.com/PracticumAI/computer_vision](https://github.com/PracticumAI/computer_vision)

Using the same resources as in module 1, complete notebook **03_spot_the_cows.ipynb**, which will introduce you to image segmentation.
