# Courses

Practicum AI is a hands-on applied Artificial Intelligence learning curriculum intended for beginners in AI with limited coding and math background. Our approach is to use visual and conceptual explanations, coupled with hands-on coding exercises to lead learners through a progression of content from beginner to more advanced. AI is not just for computer scientists and we seek to broaden diversity of both AI practitioners and the domains where AI is applied. Our content is open source and freely available for learners as well as instructors who may want to adapt modules for their own teaching. For those wishing to obtain certificates, the content will also soon be available via UF Professional and Workforce Development.
