## Welcome to the *Practicum AI*: Deep Learning Foundations course! 

Welcome to the PracticumAI: Deep Learning Foundations course! This course is the fourth in the Practicum AI series. This course can also be taken on its own to familiarize yourself with some of the important tools used in computer science applications.  

This course is intended to demystify the concepts of neural networks and deep learning. We will touch on how neural networks work, how to use them, and why neural networks have dominated AI research in the past decade. The first module of this course provides a high-level overview of deep learning and some hands-on experience with using these models. This course builds on the previous Practicum AI courses and will require some knowledge of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and high-performance computing environments.

## In this course weâ€™ll cover:

* **Module 1**: [Getting Started with Deep Learning](/deep_learning/01_getting_started_dl/)
* **Module 2**: [Deep Learning, Opening the Machine](/deep_learning/02_dl_open_machine/)
* **Module 3**: How to Tune Your Models

Good luck!
