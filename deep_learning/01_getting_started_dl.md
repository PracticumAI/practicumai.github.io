## Exercise

Now that we've thoroughly explored the basics of neural networks, let's get our hands dirty with creating one ourselves. The following exercise will use the Python coding language inside a Jupyter Notebook environment to give you a quick introduction to doing AI with code!

The notebooks for the Deep Learning Foundations course are located at the [deep learning directory on our Practicum AI GitHub](https://github.com/PracticumAI/deep_learning).

* Click the "Use this template" button to make your copy of the repository.
   * If you need details on how to do this, please see this page on creating your GitHub repository from the template.
* Open a session on HiPerGator, Google Colab, or your HPC (we will want a GPU for these exercises).
   * If you need details for this step, please view the appropriate page:
      * Launching Jupyter on HiPerGator.
      * Launching a Google Colab session.
* Work through notebook **01_deep_learning_tour.ipynb**.
