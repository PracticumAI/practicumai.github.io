<a href="https://github.com/PracticumAI/python"><img src='/images/icons/practicumai_python.png' alt='Practicum AI Python course logo' align='right' width=200></a> As we continue to build out our *Practicum AI* learning experiences, the [Python lessons](https://github.com/PracticumAI/python) have now been extensively revised. We no longer rely on an outside text and provide all of the learning content and exercises in the notebooks.

Content has also been reorganized a bit and cleaned up.

As always, instructors can gain access to the teacher versions of the notebooks by filling out the [instructor application](/instructor_app)
