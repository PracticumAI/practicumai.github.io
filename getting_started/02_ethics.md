## Summary

Artificial Intelligence has great promise for advancing human understanding. However, when used inappropriately or when consequences and limitations are not considered, AI has the potential to do great harm, most often disproportionately impacting marginalized populations. While this module deals directly with ethical considerations of AI technologies, it will not be the only place ethical considerations are discussed in the Practicum AI curriculum. We address broad frameworks to facilitate ongoing discussions of ethical, equitable and just AI.

## Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Compare and contrast the ethical frameworks of Consequentialism and Deontology.
1. Describe the issue of biased data and why training data ought to be representative of a given population.
1. Evaluate data collection processes and data sets to ensure alignment to a research question or AI service.
1. Recognize the inherent complexity of ethical thinking and the need to balance competing interests.
1. Summarize the limitations of narrow AI:
    a. Open category problem
    b. Model brittleness
    c. Others
