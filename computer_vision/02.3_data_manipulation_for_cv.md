Raw image and video data often need careful adjustments before a computer vision model can effectively learn from them.  Data manipulation techniques are essential for bridging the gap between raw pixels and usable input for machine learning algorithms.

## Image Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing steps aim to create a consistent and optimized representation of image data, making it easier for computer vision models to learn effectively.

* **Resizing:** Ensures all images in your dataset have the same dimensions required by the chosen model architecture (e.g., 224x224 pixels). Some newer architectures can accommodate input of varying sizes.
* **Normalization:** Scale pixel values to a common range (often 0-1 or -1 to 1) for improved training stability. Normalization also reduces the impact of extreme pixel values or varying lighting conditions.
* **Channel Conversion:** Convert images to the modelâ€™s color format (e.g., convert images with more than three spectral bands to RGB format). Reducing the number of channels also decreases training complexity.
